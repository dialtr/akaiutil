Akai Disk Structures

This document outlines the key data structures used in the Akai S900, S1000, and
S3000 series samplers, as reverse-engineered in the akaiutil program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disk Identification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identifying an Akai-formatted disk involves checking for specific "magic"
values within the disk's header structures.

S900 Hard Disk:
- An S900 hard disk is identified by the `akai_hd9head_s` structure.
- The `flag1` field within this structure is set to `0xff` if the disk size
  information is valid.

S1000/S3000 Hard Disk Sampler Partition:
- A sampler partition is identified by the `akai_parthead_s` structure.
- This structure contains a `magic` array with `AKAI_PARTHEAD_MAGICNUM` (98)
  fields. Each entry `i` in this array should contain the value `3333 + i`
  to be considered valid.
- The `tagsmagic` field will contain the string "TAGS" if tags are present
 .

S1000/S3000 Hard Disk Partition Table:
- The partition table, `akai_parttab_s`, is found within the first sampler
  partition.
- It contains a `magic` array with `AKAI_PARTTAB_MAGICNUM` (128) fields
 . Each entry `i` in this array should contain the value `9999 + i` to be
  considered valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Akai disks are organized into partitions, which can be of several types:

- **Floppy Partitions:** `PART_TYPE_FLL` (low-density) and `PART_TYPE_FLH`
  (high-density) for floppy disks.
- **S900 Hard Disk:** `PART_TYPE_HD9` for S900 hard disks.
- **S1000/S3000 Sampler Partition:** `PART_TYPE_HD` for sampler partitions on
  S1000/S3000 hard disks.
- **S1100/S3000 DD Partition:** `PART_TYPE_DD` for Direct-to-Disk recording
  partitions.

Partitions contain a header (`akai_parthead_s` for S1000/S3000, `akai_hd9head_s`
for S900), a File Allocation Table (FAT), and a root directory for volumes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volumes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Volumes are collections of files within a partition.

- **S900 Hard Disk:** Volumes are defined by `akai_hd9rootdir_entry_s` in the
  root directory of the S900 hard disk header. Each entry contains the
  volume name and its starting block on the hard disk.

- **S1000/S3000 Sampler Partition:** Volumes are defined by `akai_rootdir_entry_s`
  in the root directory of the sampler partition header. Each entry
  contains the volume name, type (S1000 or S3000), load number, and its starting
  block within the partition.

Each volume contains its own directory of files, defined by the
`akai_voldir_entry_s` structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files are the individual pieces of data, such as samples, programs, or other
settings.

- **File Directory Entry:** The `akai_voldir_entry_s` structure describes each
  file within a volume. It contains:
  - **name:** The file's name.
  - **tag:** Up to four tags for categorization (S1000/S3000).
  - **type:** The file type, such as sample, program, etc..
  - **size:** The size of the file in bytes.
  - **start:** The starting block of the file within the partition.
  - **osver:** The OS version associated with the file.

- **File Types:** The `akaiutil_file.h` header defines various file types,
  including:
  - `AKAI_SAMPLE900_FTYPE`, `AKAI_SAMPLE1000_FTYPE`, `AKAI_SAMPLE3000_FTYPE` for
    samples.
  - `AKAI_PROGRAM900_FTYPE`, `AKAI_PROGRAM1000_FTYPE`, `AKAI_PROGRAM3000_FTYPE` for
    programs.
  - And many others for drum settings, effects, cue lists, etc..

- **File Headers:** Many file types have their own specific headers, such as
  `akai_sample900_s` for S900 samples or `akai_program1000_s` for S1000 programs
 . These headers contain detailed information specific to that file type
 .

This structure, from the disk level down to individual files, allows for the
organization and management of the sampler's data.
